# Kantai 3D
Kantai 3D is a third-party mod for Kancolle - Kantai Collection. It brings 3D-like effects to (some of) your secretaries. 

It is NOT Live2D. It is parallax occlusion mapping (POM) rendering technique which uses a depth map to simulate occlusion of 3D lightray. 3D AAA game usually use this technique 乞walls and floor for extra bump visual effects.

# Supported CGs

Drawing depth maps is very time consuming and the number of supported CGs is slowing increasing.

You can find the name of the supported ships [Here](https://github.com/users/laplamgor/projects/1#column-10244994)

Currently Kantai 3D does not support any medium damaged CG.

# Installation

Currently Kantai 3D is only available for PC and there for two options to install it.

# Contribute your own depth Map

In long term, I would like this project to be fan-based. It definitely needs more than one busy poor man to draw all depth maps for 200+ ships and 500+ CGs.

~~I have created a [Photoshop Extension](https://github.com/laplamgor/kantai3d-photoshop-extension) to preview 3D effect in almost realtime.~~

~~The [depth map drawing tutorial/guildline](https://github.com/laplamgor/kantai3d-depth-maps/wiki/0.-Before-You-Start) is still unfinished.~~

~~But you can still download [all the depth maps PSD source files](https://github.com/laplamgor/kantai3d-depth-maps) to study how it works.~~

I have created an [online editor](https://github.com/laplamgor/kantai3d-online-editor) to draw depth map.

You can create depth map for your favorite ship CG. (CG base image will not not provided by me due to copyright.)
