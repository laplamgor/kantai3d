# Kantai 3D
Kantai 3D is a third-party mod for Kancolle - Kantai Collection. It brings 3D-like effects to (some of) your secretaries.

It is NOT Live2D. It is parallax occlusion mapping (POM) rendering technique which uses a depth map to simulate occlusion of 3D lightray. The first game to use this technique is Crysis.

# Supported CGs

Drawing depth maps is very time consuming and the number of supported CGs is slowing increasing.

You can find the name of the supported ships [Here](https://github.com/users/laplamgor/projects/1#column-10244994)

Currently Kantai 3D does not support any medium damaged CG.

# Installation

Currently Kantai 3D is only available for PC and there for two options to install it.

For Chrome user, please check out the [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/laplamgor/kantai3d-chrome-extension).

For other user, you can use install throught [KanColle Cache Proxy Patcher](https://github.com/laplamgor/kantai3d-kccp-patcher).
The KCCP patcher requires [KC Cache Proxy](https://github.com/Tibowl/KCCacheProxy). 

# Contribute your own depth Map

In long term, I would like this project to be fan-based. It definitely needs more than one busy poor man to draw all depth maps for 200+ ships and 500+ CGs.

I have created a [Photoshop Extension](https://github.com/laplamgor/kantai3d-photoshop-extension) to preview 3D effect in almost realtime.

The [depth map drawing tutorial/guildline](https://github.com/laplamgor/kantai3d-depth-maps/wiki/0.-Before-You-Start) is still unfinished.

But you can still download [all the depth maps PSD source files](https://github.com/laplamgor/kantai3d-depth-maps) to study how it works.


# Disclaimer
Kantai 3D does not modify any ingame API request and response, nor affect your noraml gameplay.
However, just like OOI proxy or KC3Kai browser, Kantai 3D is not an officially approved program.

Please use it at your own risk. 


This mod alone, does not include any data from the origin game. All depth maps used are also 100% hand-drawn.
